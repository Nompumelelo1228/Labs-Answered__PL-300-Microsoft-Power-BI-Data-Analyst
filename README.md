# Labs-Answered__PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst
I followed the Microsoft PL-300 Power BI Labs to learn about the different things I could do with Power BI. And most of it was done in Power BI desktop.

# What I learned
* How to prepare data with power query.
* How to load data with power query.
* How to configure data model.
* How to create DAX calculations.
* How to design reports.
* How to perform analysis.
* How to create a Power BI dashboard (not in Power BI desktop).
* Row level security.
